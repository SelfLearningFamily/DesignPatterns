# Design Patterns (Kotlin)

A curated **Kotlin/JVM** codebase that demonstrates classic **software design patterns** with clean, runnable examples.

Even with senior-level experience, design patterns are something you revisit often—this repository captures that refresher work in a structured way and makes it public so others can benefit from it too.

## What’s inside

Currently covered:
- **Factory Pattern** — `src/main/kotlin/factory`
- **Builder Pattern** — `src/main/kotlin/builder`
- **Prototype Pattern** — `src/main/kotlin/prototype`

Each pattern is grouped in its own package and includes a **dedicated README within the module/folder** for deeper explanation, intent, and usage notes.
